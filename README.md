# Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Denis. I'm a designer, frontend developer, and engineer. I'm building my dream interfaces, web sites and apps for more than 10 years. And yet barely started )


## [Chromatone]((https://chromatone.center) â€“ the visual music language 
#### Author, researcher and developer 

Many of my interactive web applications are based on my own research of sound and music. It all comes up to a whole new way of seeing music. WebMIDI, ToneJS, PaperJS and many more pieces of great thought bring up a collection of open-souce web applications.

## [Etovoteto]((https://etovoteto.ru) â€“ the word creation board game and the dictionary of imaginary words
#### Author, designer and developer 

From our research we found that every human can easily create a new imaginary word, and using this opportunity is very interesting and fun. We're inventing easy ways to play with new words and their meanings.
