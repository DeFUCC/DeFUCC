# Hi üëã
My name is Denis. I'm a designer, frontend developer, and engineer. I'm building my dream interfaces, web sites and apps for more than 10 years. And yet barely started )

I've founded and continue developing a couple of open source sociocultural projects. It means they start from a great idea and clean goals, then find the people to conciously engage in the charity community. I create open source social beneficial projects and look for two kinds of people: those who have wish and opportunity to participate in the development and realisation processes, and those who may support them by a star, a post or a donation. So the initiatives will live as long as we like them! ‚ú®

## My GitHub hosted initiatives

[Chromatone](https://github.com/chromatone) ‚Äì the visual music language, [tsoop.ru](https://github.com/tsoop-ru) ‚Äì the live multimedia generation project,  [Etovoteto](https://github.com/etovoteto) ‚Äì the word creation board game and the dictionary of imaginary words], [DeFUCC](https://github.com/DeFUCC) - Development Foundation for Universalization, Cooperation and Creativity, and there's more. My main way of expression are websites and webapps, so I'm deep into the modern frontend development. And I welcome you here! üåä

## Share love!

I can sustain myself on commercial projects, but it takes time. The time I would be happy to spend on building free and open source projects for societal benefit. You can support open source development now. Simply buy me a coffee to stay focused on it! ‚òïÔ∏è
