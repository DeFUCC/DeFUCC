# Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Denis. I could be a designer, a frontend developer, or an engineer, but I mix all of this and more into broad range self-guided open-source creator. I'm building dream interfaces, web sites and apps for more than 12 years. And have so much more to improve on! I'm deep into the modern frontend web development, and this page is home for all of the code I've been contributing to the global web community since 2012. And I welcome you here! ðŸŒŠ

I've founded and continue development of a network of open source sociocultural projects today. Each project starts from a good idea and transparent goals, then find the people to conciously engage in volunteering for the best of all. I started creating open source social projects by myself, but there are numerous collaborations that demonstrated them as really viable for other people and communities. I would be glad to meet new engaged people along the way. And I would be happy if you know why it's good for you to: 

A. participate in any of our projects development and realisation in any role and position, 
B. support my projects with a star, mention, post, donation or any other resources you are willing to invest in brighter future for all.
 
So the initiatives will keep living for as long as we have fun making world better together! âœ¨

I believe I can find a good balance of making viable commercial projects along with sharing open source knowledge hubs and services for everyone to use and build upon. I know that millions of people will pass by before we meet with those, who can appreciate the work and have enough will to go for something non-profit based and self-motivated projects. But I'm taking the risk and know that once we'll have an international community of exceptional geeks reimagining the world as a collection of open-source projects.
