# Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Denis. I could be a designer, a frontend developer, or an engineer, but I combine all that and more into broad range self-guided web development. I'm building my dream interfaces, web sites and apps for more than 10 years. And yet barely started! I'm deep into the modern frontend development, and this page is home for all of the code I've been contributing to the global community since 2012. And I welcome you here! ðŸŒŠ

I've founded and continue development a network of open source sociocultural projects today. Each project starts from a good idea and transparent goals, then find the people to conciously engage in volunteering for the best. I started creating open source social projects by myself, but there are numerous collaborations that demonstrated them as really viable for real people and communities. I would be glad to meet new engaged people along the way. And would be happy if you somehow know why it's good for you and your friends to: 

A. participate in any of our projects development and realisation in any role and position, 
B. support my projects with a star, mention, post, donation or any other resources you are willing to invest in brighter future for all.
 
So the initiatives will keep living for as long as we have fun making world better together! âœ¨
